`pthread_mutex_t bmtx = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;`  

This line initializes a **mutex** (`bmtx`) using the **static initializer** `PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER`. Here's what it does:



### **How does this work?**
1. **`pthread_mutex_t`** is a data structure that represents a mutex.
2. **`PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER`** is a **constant initializer** provided by POSIX to initialize the mutex without calling `pthread_mutex_init()`.
   - It is used for **statically allocated** mutexes.
   - This is useful when you don't want to initialize the mutex at runtime.

### **Alternative: Manual Initialization**
If `bmtx` were dynamically allocated or needed custom attributes, you would initialize it like this:
```c
pthread_mutex_init(&bmtx, NULL);
```
And at the end of the program:
```c
pthread_mutex_destroy(&bmtx);
```
But since `PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER` is used, you **don't need** `pthread_mutex_init()`.
